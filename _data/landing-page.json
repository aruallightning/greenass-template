      "answer": "You should look out for the “FSC Recycled” label,  or even better, the “Blauer Engel” certificate. You’ll often find “FSC Mix,” but that label indicates that the fibers come from a mix of recycled, controlled and certified wood and doesn’t make public what percentage each is, it therefore generally implies that it’s mainly made of virgin wood, sometimes even from uncertified forests, and that very little raw material comes from recycled fibers.

      "answer": "In a sustainable forest the trees are cut selectively so that a variation of different aged trees is kept within the forest. Which is a good thing but still not unproblematic. These methods are not perfect and still have plenty of repercussions for wildlife through habitat destruction just as every other human involvement in ecosystems. Poor management practices also result in erosion and impaired water quality in that area. It also must be regarded that the growing tree stock degenerates progressively with every felling thus reducing the forests resilience.\\\n\\\nSelective system forestry is a standard technique but when clear cuts and plantations are labelled as the conventional sustainable method people are made to think they are doing something good for the environment by purchasing virgin fibers from \"sustainable sources\" although the only sustainable version of an one-use product like toilet paper can be recycled. Wood that would otherwise be used for other higher complexity objects such as chairs and guitars is instead flushed down the toilet. This is greenwashing at its best and that is why we are opposing it. Sources: [\\[3]](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/sustainable-forestry)",
